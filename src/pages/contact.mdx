# Contact Me

You can get in touch with me by opening the nearest window by yelling out of it real loud.

## Or you can wave to me

Just click this button to simulate a friendly wave.

<Wave />
 
Please note  may not wave back. This is because I'm very far away and probably didn't see you click this button.
